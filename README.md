# Building-Flights-Delay-Data-Dashboard
## Introduction
In this project, i've already created visualization to reveal insights from Flight Delays and Cancellations data set. This data set comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. I've created 4 different visualizations, a dashboard and a story from this data set using Tableau and used visual encodings, design principles, effective communication and data visualization.
